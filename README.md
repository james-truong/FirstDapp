# FirstDapp

Built a token sale/ICO using two smart contracts that worked together to administer the process. 
I used Ganache to test it locally on a dummy blockchain along with truffle before trying to deploy to Rinkeby TestNet. Sadly, I was unable to recieve Eth from this network so I was unable to
deploy using Geth. Will get back to this once I get approved credits for gas fees.

This follows ERC20 standard found on the Ethereum github docs.
Users are able to purchase a subset amount of private tokens from the total amount.
